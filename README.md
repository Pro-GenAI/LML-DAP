#### Why LML & DAP?
- Classification tasks are typically handled using Machine Learning (ML) models, which lack a balance between accuracy and interpretability.
- This project introduces a new approach to using Large Language Models (LLMs) for classification tasks in an explainable way.
- Unlike ML models that rely heavily on data cleaning and feature engineering, this method streamlines the process using LLMs.
